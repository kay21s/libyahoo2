Well, I added documentation some time ago.  It's in the README file.  I
suppose people have found it.

The good news now is that libyahoo2 is being used in many clients, the
bad news is that there's very little discussion on the mailing list.

Hope to come out with 0.6 Real Soon Now.

Umm, ok, it's been in everybuddy for a few months, and now I'm releasing
it as a separate project.

libyahoo2 has its own life now.
