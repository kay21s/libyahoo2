Added address book support.  Rodney Dawes helped make the library
versioned.  I've also added the htdocs to CVS to make updates easier.
0.6.2 should come out Real Soon Now.

The mailing list has been alive for a while.  There's been some good
discussions.

Also added documentation for the YMSG-9 protocol and the Addressbook
structure.

libyahoo2 is used in Ayttm - a fork of everybuddy.

There have been requests for a Java version/wrapper.  Any volunteers?

This is a service release, mainly to fix the segfault on certain error
notification packets.


* 9-Oct-2002

0.6 has been released.  Also just found out that libyahoo2 is also used in
GNUYahoo

Well, I added documentation some time ago.  It's in the README file.  I
suppose people have found it.

The good news now is that libyahoo2 is being used in many clients, the
bad news is that there's very little discussion on the mailing list.

From what has been reported to me, and what I've heard, it seems that
libyahoo2 is being used in Everybuddy, Fire, Proteus, Kopete, centericq.


Hope to come out with 0.6 Real Soon Now.

Umm, ok, it's been in everybuddy for a few months, and now I'm releasing
it as a separate project.

libyahoo2 has its own life now.
