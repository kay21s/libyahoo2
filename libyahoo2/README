README for libyahoo2
====================

This file isn't done yet.  I'll get down to it soon.  There's also no docs
available, so for now, the following will have to suffice.

* Using the library

#include <yahoo2.h>
#include <yahoo2_callbacks.h>


Functions in yahoo2.h are what you must call
Functions in yahoo2_callbacks.h are what you must implement

yahoo_httplib.h has some utility functions, at most you may need to call
yahoo_urldecode to decode urls during HTTP based file transfer.


All datatypes and constants are defined in yahoo2_types.h, except for
yahoo_input_condition which is defined in yahoo2_callbacks.h

See the sample program sample_client.c for tips on how to write your own
client.
